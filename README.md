The two programs implement the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) compression technique, with the first focusing solely on string compression and the second providing a complete tool for compressing and decompressing text files. The first program reads a user-input string and compresses it by replacing consecutive repeated characters with a single character followed by the number of occurrences, showcasing the fundamental logic of RLE. It is ideal for understanding how basic data compression works at the character level. The second program builds on this by offering a menu-driven tool that operates on text files. It allows users to compress an input file into a compact format using RLE and also decompress previously compressed files to restore the original content. This version demonstrates practical file handling in C and provides a real-world application of RLE, making it useful for introductory data compression and file processingÂ tasks.
